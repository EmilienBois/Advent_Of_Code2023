# Advent_Of_Code2023
Repository containing my works on the advent of code 2023, which I have done during the programming languages course. Most of the code is made in GO language.

DAY 1 :

Work has been way harder than I thought it would be. However, I manage to do it in 45 min. I'm startled how different it is from during the class. It is quite stressfull.
Let's see how tomorrow goes, I'll start it earlier in the day.

DAY 2 : 

I started earlier this day, and I enjoyed doing it. 
I found no real difficulties, except dealing with the spaces in the string. I used 40 min for the first part, whereas the second part only took me 5 minutes to complete.
It is a pleasure for now.
