# Advent_Of_Code2023
Repository containing my works on the advent of code 2023, which I have done during the programming languages course. Most of the code is made in GO language.

DAY 1 :

Work has been way harder than I thought it would be. However, I manage to do it in 45 min. I'm startled how different it is from during the class. It is quite stressfull.
Let's see how tomorrow goes, I'll start it earlier in the day.

DAY 2 : 

I started earlier this day, and I enjoyed doing it. 
I found no real difficulties, except dealing with the spaces in the string. I used 40 min for the first part, whereas the second part only took me 5 minutes to complete.
It is a pleasure for now.

DAY 3 :

I've had some real hard time completing this day. I've spent a lot of time on debugging, showing I need to be more carefull when I code.
First problem I'm confronted : using const to make two dimensional tab. I managed to do the day without using this object, but I still need to know in advance the length of the input to do the exercice. My problem is that I don't know how to make a function return a const.
Second problem was that my number was counted too many times, but I managed it quickly. 
At first I tried to repertory all the symbols in the input, but I noticed later that I forgot some, which made me think of finding not dot or number element to fing symbol, which was way easier.
I'm quite scared about tomorrow.
